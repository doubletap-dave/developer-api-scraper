# Refactoring Phase 5: Documentation & Final Compliance
**Version**: `1.3.1`

## Objective
Ensure 100% compliance with the `python_modular_design.md` standards across the entire refactored codebase. The primary focus will be on adding comprehensive Google-style docstrings to all modules, classes, and public methods.

---

## 1. Code Audit with `flake8`
Run a full linting pass on the codebase to catch any remaining style or complexity issues.

*   **Action**: Run `pre-commit run --all-files` or `flake8 .`
*   **Goal**: The command should report zero errors. Fix any issues that are found.

## 2. Documentation Sweep
Go through every file in the `wyrm/` directory and ensure it meets our documentation standards.

*   **Target Directory**: `wyrm/`
*   **Action**: For each file:
    1.  **Module Docstring**: Add a top-level docstring explaining the module's purpose.
    2.  **Class Docstring**: Add a docstring to every class explaining its responsibility.
    3.  **Method/Function Docstring**: Add a complete Google-style docstring to every `public` method and function.
        *   Must include a one-line summary.
        *   Must include an `Args:` section detailing each parameter, its type, and description.
        *   Must include a `Returns:` section detailing the return value, its type, and description.
        *   Must include a `Raises:` section for any exceptions the function is expected to raise.
    4.  Private methods (e.g., `_private_method`) do not require docstrings but should have clear names.

### Priority Files for Documentation:
- `main.py`
- `wyrm/services/orchestrator.py`
- `wyrm/services/config_service.py`
- `wyrm/services/driver_manager.py`
- `wyrm/services/navigation_service.py`
- `wyrm/services/scraping_service.py`
- `wyrm/services/storage_service.py`
- `wyrm/models/config.py`
- `wyrm/models/scrape.py`

## 3. Final Review of `python_modular_design.md`
Read through the standards document one last time and compare it against the current state of the codebase.

*   **Checklist**:
    *   [ ] Are all file/class/function sizes within limits?
    *   [ ] Is `main.py` a "thin" entrypoint?
    *   [ ] Is all logic contained within a service class?
    *   [ ] Are Pydantic models used for all data transfer?
    *   [ ] Is `Typer` used for the CLI?
    *   [ ] Are all public methods and classes documented with Google-style docstrings?

## 4. Update Version
Update the project version for this patch release.

*   **File**: `VERSION`
*   **Action**: Change the content from `1.3.0` to `1.3.1`.

## 5. Merge to `main`
Once this phase is complete, the `refactor/modular-architecture` branch is ready to be reviewed and merged into the `main` branch.

## Expected Outcome
- The codebase is 100% compliant with the new architectural standards.
- Every module, class, and function is clearly documented, making the code easy for new developers to understand.
- The `flake8` linter passes without any errors.
- The project is in a clean, stable, and maintainable state, ready for future feature development.
- The project version is updated to `1.3.1`.
