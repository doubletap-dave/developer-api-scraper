# Refactoring Phase 1: Setup & Tooling
**Version**: `1.0.1`

## Objective
Establish the development environment and automated enforcement of the standards defined in `python_modular_design.md`.

---

## 1. Create `VERSION` File
Create a new file named `VERSION` in the project root. This file will be the single source of truth for the project's version.

*   **File**: `VERSION`
*   **Content**: `1.0.1`

## 2. Update `requirements.txt`
Add the new mandatory dependencies for our standardized tooling.

*   **File**: `requirements.txt`
*   **Action**: Add the following lines:
    ```
    pydantic
    typer[all]
    ```

## 3. Update `requirements-dev.txt`
Add the development dependencies required for linting and code quality enforcement.

*   **File**: `requirements-dev.txt`
*   **Action**: Add the following lines:
    ```
    flake8
    flake8-bugbear
    flake8-comprehensions
    flake8-docstrings
    mccabe
    pre-commit
    ```

## 4. Create `flake8` Configuration
Create a `.flake8` configuration file in the project root to enforce our code style and complexity rules.

*   **File**: `.flake8`
*   **Content**:
    ```ini
    [flake8]
    max-line-length = 88
    extend-ignore = E203
    max-complexity = 10
    
    # Docstring checks
    docstring-convention = google
    
    # Naming conventions
    # B008: Do not perform function calls in argument defaults.
    # B010: Do not call setattr with a constant attribute value.
    extend-select = B008, B010
    ```
    *Note: `max-complexity` from `mccabe` helps enforce function size limits indirectly.*

## 5. Create `pre-commit` Configuration
Set up a `pre-commit` hook to automatically run `flake8` on every commit, preventing non-compliant code from entering the repository.

*   **File**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
*   **Content**:
    ```yaml
    repos:
    -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
        rev: v4.3.0
        hooks:
        -   id: trailing-whitespace
        -   id: end-of-file-fixer
        -   id: check-yaml
        -   id: check-added-large-files
    
    -   repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
        rev: 4.0.1
        hooks:
        -   id: flake8
    ```

## 6. Installation & Verification
Provide instructions for the developer to install the new tools and run them for the first time.

*   **Action**: Run the following commands:
    ```bash
    # Install new dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    
    # Set up the git hooks
    pre-commit install
    
    # Run against all files to see the initial report
    pre-commit run --all-files
    ```

## Expected Outcome
- The project version is now officially `1.0.1`.
- The development environment is standardized with linters and pre-commit hooks.
- All subsequent code changes will be automatically checked against our new quality standards.
- We have a baseline report of existing code quality issues to address in the following phases.
